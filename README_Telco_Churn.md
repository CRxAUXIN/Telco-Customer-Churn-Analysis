This advanced project analyzes telecom customer behavior to identify churn drivers, segment high-risk customers, estimate revenue impact, and propose retention strategies. It demonstrates real-world analytics skills expected from a 1–2 year experienced Data Analyst.

## Files Included
- `customers.csv` — customer demographics & tenure
- `services.csv` — plan details & monthly charges
- `usage.csv` — aggregated usage features & complaints
- `billing.csv` — payment method, late payments & totals
- `churn.csv` — churn label and churn probability
- `analysis.py` — Python analysis script (generates KPIs, plots, CSV outputs)
- `analysis.sql` — sample SQL queries for analytics
- `high_risk_customers.csv` — generated by analysis script (after running)
- `top_ltv_customers.csv` — generated by analysis script (after running)
- `kpis.json` — generated summary KPIs (after running)

## How to use
1. Download the CSV files and scripts.
2. Run `analysis.py` in the same folder (requires pandas, matplotlib, numpy).
3. Inspect outputs: `kpis.json`, `high_risk_customers.csv`, `top_ltv_customers.csv`, and `churn_by_plan.png`.

## Key Analyses Performed
- Overall churn rate and contract-wise churn
